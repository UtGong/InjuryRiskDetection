RECOMMENDATIONS:
===============

• Address rectus femoris overactivity with stretching and eccentric hamstring strengthening.
• Implement targeted gluteus medius strengthening exercises and neuromuscular control drills.
• Focus on hamstring strengthening exercises (Nordic curls, Romanian deadlifts) to improve H:Q ratio.
• Gradually progress loading of calf muscles and consider monitoring ground reaction forces during activity.
